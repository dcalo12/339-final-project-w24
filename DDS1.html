            <h2>Initial Release Date</h2>
            <p>July 15th, 2004</p>
            <h2>Synopsis</h2>
            <p>The player assumes the role of the main character "Serph," who is the leader of a military tribe called "The Embryons." Along with core members Heat, Argilla, Gale, ans Cielo, the player fights in turn-based battles in the "Press Turn" system (introduced in Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne). One fateful day, while in a conflict with a rival tribe called "The Vanguard," both tribes encounter what looks like a green and black plant bulb. Both triebes tell the other to remove it or it would be deemed "an act of war," but it suddenly erupts an stoots white rays into all active combatants.<br><br> What ensues can only be described as total carnage, where we see everyone turn into demons and begin to cannibalize each other. What results from the bulb explosion is called the "Atma Virus" and it gives people the ability (or perhaps, curse) to turn into demons. The caveat is that people infected with the Atma Virus need to feed on other demons, or else htey go mad and become uncontrollable. In the crater of the explosion is a young woman, not wearing clothes and in the fetal position. The Embryons take her back to their base, but are suddenly summoned and told they need to bring her to the "Karma Tower" after destroying all other tribes in order to ascend to Nirvana...</p>
